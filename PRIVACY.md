# Privacy Policy â€“ Route Map Power BI Visual

Effective date: 2025-06-17

## Overview

The Route Map Power BI Custom Visual ("the Visual") is developed and maintained by Lytiqa. This Privacy Policy describes what data the Visual processes and how it is handled.

## Data Collection

The free version of the Visual:

- Does **not** collect or transmit any personal or user data
- Does **not** send telemetry, analytics, or tracking data
- Does **not** require any login or authentication
- Operates entirely within the user's Power BI environment

All data processed by the Visual remains within Power BI and the user's browser or desktop application.

## Map Provider Notice

This version of the Visual uses **OpenStreetMap** via a free public tile service. When tiles are loaded, your IP address may be visible to the OpenStreetMap tile server. No data from your Power BI report is sent to OpenStreetMap.

If your organization requires a commercial mapping provider, please contact us for an **enterprise version** that uses **Azure Maps**, which offers privacy controls and a Microsoft-backed SLA.

## Enterprise Version

If you license the enterprise version of Route Map with Azure Maps integration, additional configurations may allow authentication via Azure AD and custom map layers. In those cases, enterprise privacy policies may apply as agreed upon in a separate contract.
